    <h1>"Careless Whispear"</h1>
    <h3>George Michael</h3>
    <p>I feel so unsure
      As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
      As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
      Calls to mind a silver screen<br>
      And all its sad good-byes</p><br>

      <p>I'm never gonna dance again<br>
      Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
      Though it's easy to pretend<br>
      I know you're not a fool</p><br>

      <p>Should've known better than to cheat a friend<br>
      And waste the chance that I'd been given<br>
      So I'm never gonna dance again<br>
      The way I danced with you</p><br>

      <p>Time can never mend<br>
      The careless whispers of a good friend<br>
      To the heart and mind<br>
      Ignorance is kind<br>
      There's no comfort in the truth<br>
      Pain is all you'll find</p><br>

      From <i>George Michael, Album: Careless Whisper, Data wydania: 1984</i>
